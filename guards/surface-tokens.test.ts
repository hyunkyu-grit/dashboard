/**
 * The three surface tokens must be declared WHERE CDS's tokens are in scope.
 *
 * ── The failure this exists for (measured 2026-08-13) ───────────────────────
 * `--sr-page` / `--sr-card` / `--sr-control` are defined in terms of CDS tokens
 * (`var(--color-bg)` and friends). They were first declared on `:root`, and all
 * three silently became the guaranteed-invalid value, because **CDS emits
 * `--color-*` as inline styles on its own ThemeProvider wrapper, not on
 * `:root`** — and a custom property's value is substituted AT THE ELEMENT WHERE
 * IT IS DECLARED.
 *
 * Nothing looked broken. `background: var(--sr-card)` with an invalid value
 * falls back to transparent, and the cards still had their border and radius, so
 * the page read as "white cards on a white page" rather than as a bug. It was
 * only caught by reading `backgroundColor` back out of the DOM.
 *
 * This repo has now hit the same class of defect three times — the font family
 * (`type.css`: a `body { --fontFamily-body: … }` override that computed to CDS's
 * own value), the theme font stack, and this. The shape is always the same: a
 * variable defined above the scope that owns the value it references.
 *
 * Source-read rather than rendered, for the same reason as `ch-context`: jsdom
 * loads no CDS stylesheet, so a rendered assertion would measure jsdom.
